### Knowledge Proof/Mapping Resume App

> **What it is**
> - Overvue
>     - A comprehensive social media app that maps an individuals knowledge and executable experience in all aspects of human knowledge as well as their comprehension of those fields. The aim of the app is not to discriminate against those who have not learned or acquired knowledge/experience, it is to level the functional playing field among individuals in the work force. The app will also have instructions and lessons for every point of knowledge, and automatically cause you to study anything you have either learned or tested proficient in at appropriate intervals. The App will be broken into 2 parts: *Knowledge* and *Experience*.
>
>      - *Knowledge* will initially be the mapping of wrote academic information, but evolve into the objective breakdown of all experiences into finite and testable increments.
> 
>      - *Experience* will be the mapping of skill sets, or practices that are not easily encapsulated by simple multiple choice questions. This section will be comprised of videos and 3d modules designed to both instruct users on how to complete the skill/task at hand as well as show what skills they have.
>
> **How it works**
>  - _Mapping_
>     - This aspect is the visual and meta framework of the application. Starting from the basics of each discipline, information is mapped incrementally, _fact point_ to _fact point_, each level opening up new _nodes_ and connecting to more disciplines. Users will be quized after each set of 5 facts, each fact being questioned from as many angles as possible. After a quick spin-up of skills needed to learn (reading, writing, typing), users will begin with the most basic of math, which will then branch into physics and history (for word problems), then move into the more nuanced fields such as language and the arts to establish how all knowledge is connected.
>  - _Fact Points_
>       - _Fact points_ are the incrementalization of knowledge. Every discipline is to be broken down and digested into its smallest unique parts, and the user will be guided through, building an understanding of every field by layering on information. Users will be quizzed every five _fact points_, each _fact point_ being examined using a "Who, what, where, when, how, why" questioning structure.
>  - _Nodes_ 
>      - _Nodes_ are the points where users are tested/quized and where information is visually shown to branch into new fields. _Nodes_ will be located every 10 facts points along the knowledge map.
>  - _Study_
>     - This feature will be a passive feature. Much like Anki or supermemo, the app will prompt the user with questions that they have already answered at intervals that will enhance their memory. A future iteration of the app will track and analyze the users learning curve and adjust quiz intervals accordingly.
>  - _Speed Reading_
>      - Another passive feature of the app. As users are guided through learning portions, speed reading techniques will be applied to enhance the users ability to read and comprehend at faster and faster speeds.
>	- _Knowledge_
>     - This section is the easiest to establish, though the most time consuming to produce. _Knowledge_ paths are the known and practiced academic disciplines (Math, Science, Language, History, etc.) from their most basic pre elementary levels all the way through doctorate practices. There will be a guided learning portion with texts, assignments, and tests, as well as the option to test out of each _node_.
>	- Experience
>     - This section is slightly harder to quantify. The _Experience_ paths are made up of video tutorials and virtual models that guide the user through an understanding of information that is harder to encapsulate in text. To accomplish assignments in this portion, the user is to upload a video of them doing the exact same process that they are learning, essentially copying the previous video. Over time, a collection of these uploads will be available to users to enhance situational memorization. This section will be subject to the same quiz structure that the _Knowledge_ section is.
> 
> Why I care
>  - My whole life I have dreamt of living in a near science fiction utopia. As I grow older, that dream fades a little bit more each day. I firmly believe that we, as a species, can reach a Star Trek future, but in order to do so we must advance our understanding of the world at a much faster rate. This application, while masked as a virtual resume, is an attempt to rapidly teach the masses all of the knowledge that we have acquired at this point, so that we are all operating on an advanced level as we move foward.

### MSSA RoR App
> What it is
>  - The accumulation of notes and assignments from the current (and eventually future) cohorts in an application form. The purpose of this app is to facilitate a faster learning for future cohort students as it will offer greater practice and reference material for the course.
>  
> How it works
> - The app will come preloaded with notes from the previous cohort, with space for the user to add notes as they need. The assignments from previous classes will also be available to solve, increasing the practice. It is meant to ac as a compiled reference of the past classes.
> 
> Why I care
> - I want to help people succeed in understanding and digesting the information the encounter. It is my goal to help facilitate the learning of any experience that I have had for the people who follow me.

### Automated Flashcard App
> What it is
> - An automated version of Anki that is more interactive and prompts you to study. 
> How it works
> - Cards will be interactive such that the user's answer is rated by the program. The program will also force you to study by locking your phone until you complete the quiz correctly.
> Why I care
> - Learning is an active process that requires great effort. Studying is the majority of that effort, and I would like to make a passive and efficient way to memorize information.
